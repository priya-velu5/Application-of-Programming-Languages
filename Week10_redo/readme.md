I've redone all the major mistakes I made. Please consider how many ever possible. Thank you for the second chance! 

`cd Week10_redo`

### Week 7: TwentySeven - added part 2 with user inputs

`g++ TwentySeven.cpp -o w27.out`

`./w27.out ../pride-and-prejudice.txt`

After this, when prompted give an input file. Eg: if you enter `../pride-and-prejudice.txt` again, you can see the counts double. 

### Week 4: Thirteen with 13.2 and 13.3

`node thirteen.js ../pride-and-prejudice.txt`

### Week 4: With 15.2

`g++ Fifteen.cpp -o w15.out`

`./w15.out ../pride-and-prejudice.txt`

### Week 3: Ten - The One style: reimplemented in java with specific use of "bind" function. 

`javac Ten.java`

`java Ten.java ../pride-and-prejudice.txt`
